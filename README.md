Miwok Language Translator App
===================================

This is an app I built working on Udacitity's Android beginner course. It is a MiWok language translator that opens up to fourse lists of works and then you can scroll through the words and click on a work to hear what the correct pronunciation is.

Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
